to guide their player across the screen without getting run over by a vehicle
or falling into water.

The frog is re-spawned at the bottom of the screen if it doesn't make it across.

Controls:

pressing the left arrow - moves the frog one square left (unless they are at the left side in which no movement occurs)
pressing the right arrow - moves the frog one square right (unless they are at the right side in which no movement occurs)
